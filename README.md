##  Methodology

**Scraped the data with the help of Python BeautifulSoup library.**

### For Table - 1

1. Imported libraries including requests for making HTTP requests, for parsing HTML content.
2. Created empty lists as Name, Sizes, MRPs , Prices, URLs to hold product-related information.

3. To scrape data from multiple pages, a variable called page is initialized with the value 1.
4. This variable helps in moving from one page to the next during the scraping process.

5. Used While to scrape data  until it finds a "Page not found" message, indicating the end of available pages.
6. After scraping data from the current page, the script increments the page variable to move on to the next page.


### For Table - 2

1. Imported libraries including requests for making HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.
2. Created empty lists as Name, brand_names, key_ingredients, ratings, number_of_ratings, key_benefits, count,to store details about each medicine.

3. Used For loop to iterate through a list of URLs from a DataFrame (df['1mg_url']).
4. Extracting data using Beautifulsoup If the name is found, it is appended to the name list. If not found, the list is populated with None.

5. Similar to the medicine name, the other details of the medicine is extracted and added to the relevant list. If it's not found, "None" is added.
6. The count variable is incremented with each URL processed, Once all URLs have been processed, the total count is printed to signify the end of the scraping process.
